Let's assume the project is built in Rust. Then the project would most likely utilize cargo, the default build system and package manager of Rust. Cargo builds the project using rustc compiler which automatically lints the code during compilation. Cargo also provides a default built-in framework for unit and integration testing, so no external testing framework is necessary.

The closest alternative to GitHub Actions is probably GitLab CI/CD. It is provided as a service, but self-hosting runners or the entire GitLab instance is possible. Self-hosted GitLab is a little resource-hungry, and a more lightweight alternative could be Gitea combined with some CI solution, such as Drone CI or its free and open-source fork Woodpecker CI.

Assuming the team has no special needs for CI, it may be better to use a cloud-based solution in this case, since the development team is quite small. Maintaining a self-hosted solution takes developer time, and depending on maintainer's experience the self-hosted CI system may have a higher risk of downtime or failures than a reputable cloud-based one with a team of professional sysadmins maintaining it. If there are special requirements, such as independence from external cloud providers, heavy testing workloads or special hardware, a self-hosted solution may be preferred.
